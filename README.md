# IT326-Project-Fitness
## Project Description
This project aims to analyze a real-world style fitness dataset and build models that can classify individuals into specific categories of fitness (fit vs. not fit) based on their health and lifestyle attributes such as age, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, sleep hours, nutrition, and smoking habits. In addition to classification, the project also explores clustering techniques to group individuals with similar health profiles, allowing us to identify common lifestyle patterns that influence fitness levels.

The problem we want to solve is: Can we predict whether a person is fit or not using their health and lifestyle data, and can we group people into clusters with similar wellness characteristics?
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore a publicly available dataset containing survey responses from individuals with and without depression. By analyzing factors such as income, family status, and other personal characteristics, we aim to identify potential patterns and relationships associated with depression. This project serves as a learning exercise in data mining and classification techniques, allowing us to apply what weâ€™ve learned in our coursework to a real-world dataset and gain insights into how different variables may correlate with depression.
